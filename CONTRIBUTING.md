# Contributing to famous-flex

## Develop-branch

All Pull-requests should be made on the 'develop'-branch.
Pull-requests on the 'master' -branch will not be accepted.


## Documentation

Please note that documentation (i.e. everything in the `docs` directory) is
**automatically generated**.  As such, contributions should be made to the
respective `.js` source file used to generate the final markdown.

e.g. `src/layouts/CollectionLayout.js` contains the source documentation
used to generate `docs/layouts/CollectionLayout.md`.  Only the former
should be modified.
